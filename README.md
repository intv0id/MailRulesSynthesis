# MailRulesSynthesis
Use programming by example for email rules synthesis

## Project description

This project aims to be a proof of concept of an email rules learner driven by examples. 

**It's currently still in early development**

## Tools

- [Dotnet core v2.2](https://dotnet.github.io/)
- [Prose SDK](https://microsoft.github.io/prose/)

## Test Dataset

We are currently using the [Enron Email Dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/) to simulate real mails as we can't yet plug our programm on top of existing mail clients such as Thunderbird or Outlook.
